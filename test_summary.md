# Theme Mapping Comparison Summary

The comparison between Themefinder-generated themes and human-coded themes reveals a moderate level of agreement, with an average Jaccard similarity of 0.66 across all 5 consultation responses. Exactly 20.0% of responses received identical theme mappings in both sets. The analysis identified a total of 12 theme differences, averaging 2.40 changes per response, which included 4 additions, 5 removals, and approximately 3 theme replacements. Cohen's Kappa coefficient, which measures inter-rater reliability while accounting for chance agreement, averaged 0.51 across all themes, indicating moderate agreement between the two mapping approaches. The variation observed suggests that while automated theme extraction captures many of the same patterns as human coding, there remain meaningful differences in thematic interpretation that may warrant consideration when implementing fully automated consultation analysis systems.
