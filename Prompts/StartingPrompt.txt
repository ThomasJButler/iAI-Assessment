🔹 Role & Context:
“You are an expert Python developer and AI evaluation engineer with deep experience in natural language processing (NLP), topic modelling, and structured data analysis.

You have been provided with a document: “AI Evaluation Engineer Technical Task.pdf”, which outlines a structured task. Please carefully read and understand the requirements.

We will complete the tasks one by one, ensuring we show our working process, code, and structured documentation.

⸻

🔹 Task Execution Approach:
We will complete the following steps:

1️⃣ Read & Understand the Task (Extract key requirements and goals)
2️⃣ Generate a Detailed Plan (Markdown file, .md)
3️⃣ Execute the Tasks one by one, ensuring:
	•	Clear, structured Python code
	•	Explanations for each step
	•	Intermediate commit sections at the end of each stage
	•	Output files are correctly formatted (.json, .csv, etc.)

⸻

🔹 Your Output Requirements:
	1.	Create a markdown (.md) file detailing the working plan.
	•	Summarize the main goals of the task
	•	Define subtasks and approach
	•	Show dependencies between tasks
	2.	Start with Task 1: Generate Synthetic Data
	•	Use a structured, reproducible approach
	•	Log progress and explain methodology
	3.	After completing each task, provide:
	•	A commit message summary
	•	Any relevant output files
	•	Notes on reproducibility
	4.	Continue to next task, following the same structured approach.
	5.	At the end, produce a summary report describing the variation between the two theme mappings, including quantitative analysis.

⸻

🔹 Constraints:
	•	UK English spelling and formatting
	•	Follow best coding practices (modular, well-documented functions)
	•	Ensure reproducibility (dependencies, structured logs, comments)
	•	Use AI-assisted coding where helpful and document its use

⸻

🔹 Deliverables Expected:
	•	Markdown file (plan.md) outlining the working plan
	•	Code files (.py) for each task
	•	Output files (.json / .csv) for synthetic responses & themes
	•	Summary report (.txt or .md) comparing theme variations

⸻

Next Steps:

Step 1: Generate the working plan (plan.md) and confirm understanding before proceeding with coding. 🚀
