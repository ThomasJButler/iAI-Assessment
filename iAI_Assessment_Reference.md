### UK-Specific Frameworks

#### Magenta Book and AI Annex
- HM Treasury's guidance on evaluation in central government
- Specific annex for AI interventions published December 2024 by the Evaluation Task Force
- Developed in collaboration with Department for Transport and Frontier Economics

**Core Principles**
- Tailored complexity approach recognising AI's unique evaluation challenges:
  - Untested nature and rapid evolution of AI systems
  - Potential for unintended consequences (e.g., algorithmic bias)
  - High learning potential requiring iterative improvement
- Methodological priorities:
  - Randomised Control Trials (RCTs) strongly advocated to isolate causal impacts
  - Iterative evaluation combining rapid assessments during development with long-term analysis
  - Theory-based approaches for understanding AI's role in complex systems
- Key evaluation components:
  - Baseline establishment before deployment
  - Continuous monitoring of user adaptation and system evolution
  - Analysis of variation in impacts across demographic groups

**Practical Applications (Case Studies)**
The guidance illustrates methods through four scenarios:

| **AI Application** | **Evaluation Focus** | **Methods Used** |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Grant application assessment AI | Accuracy vs human reviewers' decisions | RCT comparing approval rates |
| LLM document analysis tool | Time savings vs critical thinking tradeoffs | Process tracing + staff surveys |
| Government website chatbot | User satisfaction & service deflection rates | Quasi-experimental regional comparison |
| Chronic disease priority system | Health outcomes vs algorithmic fairness | Mixed-methods causal analysis |

**Implementation Challenges**
- Data limitations: Historical data often lacks documentation of existing societal biases
- Temporal mismatch: AI systems evolve faster than traditional evaluation cycles
- Stakeholder coordination: Requires collaboration between DDaT specialists and social researchers

**Integration with Government Strategy**
- Complements the Magenta Book's existing complexity-handling approaches
- Aligns with the Generative AI Framework for Government
- Distinguishes impact evaluation (societal outcomes) from technical model evaluation
- Integrated with the £45bn productivity improvement plan announced January 2025

## 6. Code Examples for AI Evaluation

### Bias Detection in Government AI Systems

```python
# Install package
!pip install bias-detector

# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from bias_detector.BiasDetector import BiasDetector

# Load sample government dataset (e.g., public housing applications)
data = pd.read_csv("housing_applications.csv")
first_names = data["first_name"].tolist()
last_names = data["last_name"].tolist()
zip_codes = data["zip_code"].tolist()
y_true = data["eligible_true_label"].tolist()  # Ground truth
y_pred = data["eligible_pred_label"].tolist()  # Model predictions

# Initialize detector with US demographic data
bias_detector = BiasDetector(country='US')

# Generate bias report
bias_report = bias_detector.get_bias_report(
    first_names=first_names,
    last_names=last_names,
    zip_codes=zip_codes,
    y_true=y_true,
    y_pred=y_pred
)

# Visualize disparities
bias_report.plot_summary()
```

**Key Output Metrics**:  
| Metric                | Government Relevance                          | Fair Threshold |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Statistical Parity    | Equal approval rates across racial groups     | 0.8 ≤ SP ≤ 1.25|
| Equal Opportunity     | Comparable TPR for protected subgroups       | Δ ≤ 0.1        |
| Predictive Equality   | Similar FPR across genders/races             | Δ ≤ 0.05       |

### Critical Considerations for Government AI

1. **Data Hygiene**:  
   - Validate representation of marginalized communities in training data (e.g., rural/low-income groups)
   - Use anonymized sensitive attributes (race/gender) **only** for bias audits, not model training

2. **Mitigation Strategies**:  
   ```python
   # Post-processing correction (Equalized Odds)
   from aif360.algorithms.postprocessing import EqOddsPostProcessing
   mitigator = EqOddsPostProcessing(privileged_groups=[{'race': 1}], 
                                  unprivileged_groups=[{'race': 0}])
   mitigated_preds = mitigator.predict(y_pred)
   ```

3. **Compliance & Monitoring**:  
   - Align with NIST SP 1270 guidelines for systemic/human bias detection
   - Implement continuous bias monitoring using tools like Amazon SageMaker Clarify or Giskard Hub

### Policy Recommendations:  
- **Regulatory Sandboxes**: Test bias mitigation in controlled environments with synthetic data
- **Bias Impact Statements**: Document potential disparities during model development
- **Stakeholder Review Panels**: Include civil rights experts in AI governance

For sensitive applications like benefit allocation or policing, combine technical tools with socio-technical audits to address historical inequities. Metrics alone are insufficient; contextual analysis of error distributions (e.g., false positives in high-risk groups) is critical to prevent harm.
