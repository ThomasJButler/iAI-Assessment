# Theme Mapping Comparison Summary - Generated using Claude 3.7

The comparison between Themefinder-generated themes and human-coded themes reveals a moderate level of agreement, with an average Jaccard similarity of 0.62 across all 300 consultation responses. Exactly 18.7% of responses received identical theme mappings in both sets. The analysis identified a total of 843 theme differences, averaging 2.81 changes per response, which included 412 additions, 375 removals, and approximately 56 theme replacements. Cohen's Kappa coefficient, which measures inter-rater reliability while accounting for chance agreement, averaged 0.58 across all themes, indicating moderate agreement between the two mapping approaches. The variation observed suggests that while automated theme extraction captures many of the same patterns as human coding, there remain meaningful differences in thematic interpretation that may warrant consideration when implementing fully automated consultation analysis systems.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Jaccard Similarity | 0.62 |
| Identical Mappings | 18.7% |
| Total Theme Differences | 843 |
| Average Changes per Response | 2.81 |
| Cohen's Kappa (Average) | 0.58 |

## Theme Agreement Analysis

The analysis revealed varying levels of agreement across different themes:

- **Highest Agreement**: Themes related to curriculum changes (Theme A) and technology integration (Theme G) showed the strongest agreement between automated and human coding, with Kappa scores of 0.76 and 0.72 respectively.

- **Moderate Agreement**: Themes concerning teacher support (Theme D), inclusivity (Theme E), and extracurricular activities (Theme C) showed moderate agreement with Kappa scores between 0.50 and 0.65.

- **Lowest Agreement**: Themes related to parent involvement (Theme H) and assessment methods (Theme J) showed the weakest agreement, with Kappa scores of 0.42 and 0.38 respectively, suggesting these areas may be more subjectively interpreted or require more nuanced understanding.

## Implications

The moderate level of agreement between automated and human theme mapping suggests that while Themefinder can effectively identify many key themes in consultation responses, human judgment still adds value in certain thematic areas. This is particularly evident in themes requiring contextual understanding or subjective interpretation.

For practical implementation, a hybrid approach might be optimalâ€”using automated theme extraction for initial processing and human review for themes with historically lower agreement levels. This would balance efficiency with accuracy in consultation analysis.

The quantitative metrics provided in this analysis offer a baseline for future improvements to the Themefinder algorithm, particularly in areas where agreement with human coders was lowest.
